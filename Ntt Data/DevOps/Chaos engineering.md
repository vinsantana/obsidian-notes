1. Start by defining a **steady state** as a **measurable output** of a system that indicates the **normal behaviour**. 
2. **Hypothesise** that this steady state will continue in both the **control group** and the **experimental** **group**. 
3. Introduce **variables** that reflect **real world** **events**, such as servers that stop working, hard disks that malfunction, network connections that are down, etc. 
4. Try to **refute the hypothesis** by looking for a difference in steady state between the control group and the experimental group. 
5. Run the experiments in **production**. 
6. Ensure that the **consequences** of the experiments are **minimised** and **contained**. 
7. Automate experiments to run **continuously.**


**At the business level:** Chaos engineering helps stop large revenue losses by avoiding prolonged outages.

**At the technical level:** The team gains a **greater understanding** of system dependencies, allowing them to create a more robust system design.  

**At the client level:** Improved **availability** and **durability** of the service are the two main client benefits of chaos engineering.

  

**Overall:**  Enhances system recoveries, strengthens resilience and increases security.
