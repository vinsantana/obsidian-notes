Subscriptions in Azure provide a way to group and manage resources, billing, and access control. By using subscriptions, you can set permissions and access controls at the subscription level to restrict access to certain Azure resources based on departmental requirements within your organization.

- **Resource groups:** Resource groups are primarily used to organize resources that are related to the same project or have the same lifecycle. They are not specifically designed for access control based on departmental requirements.
    
      
    
- **Management groups:** Management groups are used to efficiently manage access, policies, and compliance for multiple subscriptions, providing a level of scope above subscriptions. They are more suitable for large-scale governance rather than restricting access based on departmental requirements.
    
      
    
- **Azure Active Directory:** While Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is responsible for handling authentication and authorization, it alone cannot restrict access to certain Azure resources based on departmental requirements. Instead, Azure AD is used in conjunction with other features like subscriptions to control access.
