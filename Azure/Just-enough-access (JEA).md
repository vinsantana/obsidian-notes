Just Enough Access (JEA) is a principle in [identity and access management](https://www.entitle.io/resources/glossary/identity-and-access-management-iam) that limits the rights of a user to the bare minimum they require to perform their job. Stemming from the cybersecurity concept of "[least privilege access](https://www.entitle.io/resources/glossary/least-privilege-access)," it dramatically reduces the risk associated with users possessing [excessive permissions](https://www.entitle.io/resources/glossary/excessive-permissions) or access rights. By ensuring that each user has only the necessary tools or permissions, businesses can prevent potential security breaches, while also mitigating the potential severity and impact of those that do occur.
