Criações da mente. 

- **In your day-to day work, use only applications for which you have an appropriate use license**. Do not install pirate software on your NTT DATA computer.

    **Use only the source code which is available in your project environment**. Do not re-use source code, which you have found on the Internet, or you don´t know where it came from.
        
    **When writing proposals, client deliverables, or any document that NTT DATA is going to release to the public, use only original texts and pictures**, or those available in corporate systems and from the corporate image library. Do Not use “content” only when you don´t have explicit permission to use it  (content downloaded from the Internet, from a deliverable you have from your former employer, etc.).
