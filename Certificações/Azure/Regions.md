Overall explanation

Reducing the amount of data transferred between Azure regions can help reduce costs by minimizing data egress charges.

  

**Other options:**

  

- **Deploying more virtual machines:** This can actually increase costs if they are not utilized efficiently.
    
      
    
- **Enabling automatic scaling:** This can help optimize resource usage and reduce costs, but it depends on the specific workload and usage patterns.
    
      
    
- **Keeping virtual machines running 24/7:** This can result in unnecessary costs, especially if they are not utilized all the time. It is recommended to use automation to start and stop VMs based on usage patterns.
