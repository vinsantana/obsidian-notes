To give people instructions for reporting security vulnerabilities in your project, you can add a SECURITY.md file to your repository's root, docs, or .github folder. Adding this file to this part(s) of your repository automatically creates a row with a description where people can review it. When someone creates an issue in your repository, they will see a link to your project's security policy.
