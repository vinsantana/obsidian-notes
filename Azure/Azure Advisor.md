- **Azure Advisor** is a service that provides personalized recommendations to help you optimize your Azure resources for high availability, security, performance, and cost. Azure Advisor also provides recommendations to optimize your cloud spending, but its primary focus is on providing guidance for improving the security, reliability, and performance of your Azure resources. While it may include some cost optimization recommendations, it is not solely focused on cost management and billing like Azure Cost Management and Billing. In such questions we'll always choose the BEST choice possible.
