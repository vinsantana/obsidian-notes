Pergunta 1Incorreto

Your new team member has been assigned to help you manage the code base for the new release of the stock trading application within your organization.  You are unsure how you were provided access to the code repository but would like to help your colleague get the appropriate access.  What is the best approach?

add your new team member directly to the GitHub repository

Resposta correta

reach out to the organization owner to view which teams have access to the repository and then have that owner or a team maintainer add your colleague to the appropriate team

instruct your colleague to contact GitHub support for access

Sua resposta está incorreta

reach out to the organization moderator to view which teams have access to the repository and then have them add your collegue to the appropriate team

Explicação geral

To perform any actions on GitHub a person must have sufficient access to the relevant account or resource. This access is controlled by permissions. A permission is the ability to perform a specific action. A role is a set of permissions you can assign to individuals or teams.  Teams allow you to manage access for people in an organization.  People with owner or team maintainer permissions can add organization members to teams to assign them their appropriate roles.

********************

**WRONG ANSWERS:**

- People with admin access to a repository can manage access to the repository, so while it may be possible to provide your team member access directly to the repository it is unclear if you have access to do so. In addition, adding a user directly without understanding the access process may lead to inappropriate permissions and security risks.
    
- While GitHub support can assist with certain issues, access to specific repositories is typically managed by repository owners or administrators. Relying solely on GitHub support may not be the most efficient approach for repository access.
    
- Organization moderators have access to block and unblock non-member contributors, set interaction limits, and hide comments in public repositories owned by the organization but they do not have access to assign members to teams.

Domain 6 - Privacy, Security, and Administration

Pergunta 2Incorreto

You have committed some code in your private repository but want to share it with a colleague for review and collaboration. Considering the situation, how can you easily share the code without giving your colleague direct access to your repository?

_s_hare the repository's clone URL and provide your colleague with the necessary credentials

Sua resposta está incorreta

fork your private repository and share the forked repository with your colleague

add your colleague as a collaborator to your private repository

Resposta correta

create a GitHub Gist for the code and share the Gist URL with your colleague

Explicação geral

Creating a GitHub Gist for the code and sharing the Gist URL with your colleague is the most suitable option. Gists allow you to share code snippets or files without granting access to the entire repository, making it ideal for review and collaboration.

********************

**WRONG ANSWERS:**

- Adding your colleague as a collaborator would grant them direct access to your private repository. This option doesn't align with the goal of sharing the code without providing direct repository access.
    
- Forking a private repository and sharing the forked repository would still give your colleague access to the entire codebase. This doesn't meet the requirement of sharing specific code without direct access to the repository.
    
- Sharing the repository's clone URL and credentials would give your colleague direct access to the entire repository. This approach does not align with the goal of sharing specific code only.

Domain 3 - Collaboration Features

Pergunta 3Incorreto

Which of the following best describes a GitHub project?

a repository with individual files

Sua resposta está incorreta

a version control system for tracking changes in code

Resposta correta

a collaborative space to help manage code, track issues, and plan your work

a platform for hosting personal websites

Explicação geral

A GitHub project’s primary purpose is to be an adaptable spreadsheet, task board, and road map to integrate your issues and pull requests on Github. This allows groups of people to plan and track their work effectively.

********************

**WRONG ANSWERS:**

- GitHub projects do involve repositories, but they are not limited to individual files. Github projects usually comprise of large projects with multiple files and directories.
    
- While a person can use GitHub to host personal websites, it is not the main purpose of a GitHub project. GitHub projects are mainly for collaboration and managing code, issues, and work.
    
- GitHub does embody versional control through Git. The main purpose of a GitHub project is more than just a version control system. Projects on GitHub allow for collaboration, tracking issues, and management of code.

Pergunta 4Incorreto

Who can use the Insights feature for Projects?

users with GitHub free or legacy plans

only users with admin access to a project

Resposta correta

users with write or admin access to a project

Sua resposta está incorreta

anyone who can view a project, regardless of access level

Explicação geral

The only users who can use the Insights feature for Projects are those with **write or admin access** to the specific project.

********************

**WRONG ANSWERS:**

- Being able to use the Insights feature does not have to do with the type of GitHub plan the user has, it just has to do with access levels to the project
    
- People with just viewing access cannot use the Insights feature since they do not have write or admin access on the project
    
- Although users with admin access can use Insights, it also includes users with write access

Domain 5 - Project Management

Pergunta 5Correto

What is the purpose of using project views in GitHub project management?

Sua resposta está correta

project views allow you to visualize and organize project tasks and issues across different boards, providing multiple perspectives on project progress

project views help customize the appearance of a project's README file

project views enable real-time collaboration on code editing within the GitHub repository

project views are used to set access permissions for team members in a GitHub project

Explicação geral

The main purpose of project views in GitHub project management is to allow users to visualize and organize project tasks and issues across different boards. This provides multiple perspectives on project progress and helps in effective project organization.

********************

**WRONG ANSWERS:**

- Project views are not primarily used to customize the appearance of a project's README file. They are more focused on project organization and visualization.
    
- Project views are unrelated to real-time collaboration on code editing within the GitHub repository. They are more about organizing and visualizing project tasks.
    
- Project views are not used to set access permissions for team members in a GitHub project. Access permissions are typically managed at the repository or organization level.

Dan found an interesting code repository that Sarah contributed to, which would help him save time on a project. As a result, Dan followed Sarah on GitHub. What benefits will Dan see by following a GitHub user?

be able to send a direct message to Sarah via GitHub Community

be listed in Sarah's dashboard as someone he is following.

automatically trigger an email to Sarah that he is a new follower.

Sua resposta está correta

be able to see Sarah's updates and activities in his personal dashboard.

Explicação geral

Once you star repositories or follow people, you will see updates on their activities on your personal dashboard.

********************

**WRONG ANSWERS:**

- GitHub does not default to automatically triggering emails for new followers
    
- GitHub does not connect followers for direct messaging
    
- Dan will be listed on Sarah's dashboard as a follower but not as someone he is following

Domain 7 - Benefits of the GitHub Community

Pergunta 7Correto

You and a colleague are collaborating to resolve a critical project issue. You want to receive email notifications of any comments or changes so you can address them promptly. How can you achieve this?

enable email notifications for the entire repository to stay informed about any updates

star the repository to receive enable notifications on any changes made within the repository

submit a merge request and link it to the issue

Sua resposta está correta

subscribe to the issue in GitHub to receive notifications about the latest comments

Explicação geral

To stay updated on the most recent comments in an issue, you can **subscribe to an issue to receive notifications** about the latest comments. This ensures you receive notifications specifically for the critical project issue you are collaborating on. To quickly find links to recently updated issues you're subscribed to, visit your dashboard.

********************  
**WRONG ANSWERS:**

- enabling email notifications for the entire repository might lead to information overload, as it would cover all activities within the repository.
    
- using the "Star" button on the repository would not result in email notifications for activity in the repo
    
- submitting a merge request and linking the issue would not be the correct process here as that's what you would do once that issue has been resolved

Which of the following is NOT a built-in metadata option to help build a richer view of item attributes?

Assignee

Labels

Sua resposta está incorreta

Milestone

Resposta correta

Timestamp

Explicação geral

Although a user could add a timestamp field, it is not one of the built-in metadata that GitHub provides. A user would have to add it to their project manually if it is needed in the type of project they are creating

********************

**WRONG ANSWERS:**

- Milestones are one of the built-in metadata that GitHub provides. They track progress on groups of issues or pull requests in a repository
    
- Labels are another built-in metadata that GitHub provides, they are used to classify issues, pull requests, and discussions
    
- Assignees are also a built-in metadata that GitHub provides

Pergunta 9Correto

You are participating in a GitHub discussion where comments have been made in response to a question. You've received a helpful response and want to highlight the comment to allow visitors to find the answer quickly. What action should you take?

instruct users to use discussion insights to find the answer

Sua resposta está correta

mark the comment as the answer to the discussion

create an issue and link the discussion

lock the discussion so it remains the last answer of the discussion

Explicação geral

You can mark a comment in the discussion as an answer to the discussion if a discussion is within a category that accepts answers. When you mark a question as an answer, GitHub will highlight the comment and replies to the comment to help visitors quickly find the answer.

********************  
**WRONG ANSWERS:**

- you don't need to lock the discussion. Additional comments may still allow others to ask additional questions or provide additional insight or tips for others. You should simply mark the comment as the answer.
    
- discussion insights will show data behind all of the discussions in the repo, not specific answers to questions. You should simply mark the comment as the answer.
    
- you don't need to create an issue and link the discussion. You should simply mark the comment as the answer.

Pergunta 10Correto

Isabella wants to create a new branch for a pull request but does not have write permissions to the repository. How can she create a new branch in order to propose changes to the main branch?

clone the repository to her local machine and then create the branch

ask a friend to create the branch for her

Sua resposta está correta

fork the repository first

use the GitHub UI to create the branch instead of the command line

Explicação geral

If you want to create a new branch for your pull request and do not have write permissions to the repository, you can fork the repository first. Fork the repo, create the branch with proposed changes, and submit the pull request

********************  
**WRONG ANSWERS:**

- Cloning the repo would allow you to create the branch locally, but you would not be able to push the new branch since you don't have permission
    
- Changing to the GitHub UI wouldn't give you permission to create the branch
    
- Don't ask a friend to do it. Fork the repo, create the branch with proposed changes, and submit the pull request

Pergunta 11Incorreto

You are reviewing a pull request on GitHub. The changes introduced seem promising, but you've identified a few areas that need improvement. What actions can you take to effectively contribute to the code review process? (select three)

Sua seleção está correta

provide suggestions for improvements before merging

Sua seleção está correta

request specific changes directly within the code

Sua seleção está incorreta

indicate overall approval and readiness for merging

Sua seleção está correta

comment on specific lines of code with detailed feedback

Explicação geral

You can **comment** on a pull request, **approve** the changes, or **request improvements** before approving.

You can review changes in a pull request one file at a time. While reviewing the files in a pull request, you can leave individual comments on specific changes. After you finish reviewing each file, you can mark the file as viewed. This collapses the file, helping you identify the files you still need to review. A progress bar in the pull request header shows the number of files you've viewed. After reviewing as many files as you want, you can approve the pull request or **request additional changes** by submitting your review with a summary comment.

********************

**WRONG ANSWER:**

- While approving is a valid action, it is not suitable in this scenario where areas of improvement have been identified. Approving is more appropriate when you believe the changes are ready for merging without any concerns.

Pergunta 13Correto

What type of file is used to define a workflow in GitHub Actions?

Markdown file

Sua resposta está correta

YAML file

JSON file

CSV file

Explicação geral

GitHub uses YAML because it is a commonly used, human-readable data serialization format. Its flexibility and many different use cases are why GitHub chose YAML.

********************

**WRONG ANSWERS:**

- Markdown is a lightweight markup language used for text formatting. While there are markdown files on GitHub, they are not used to define workflows. However, you can use them to document the functions of your workflow and YAML file.
    
- GitHub Actions workflows are not defined using a CSV file because CSV files are used for data storage.
    
- JSON files are used for scripting or temporary data storage.
