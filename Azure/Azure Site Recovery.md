**Azure Site Recovery (ASR)**Â is a service offered by Azure that enables replication of virtual machines from on-premises environments to Azure or between Azure regions with little or no downtime. This allows for the migration of virtual machines to Azure without any disruption to business operations. After replication to Azure, the virtual machines can be launched and used as if they were in the on-premises environment.
