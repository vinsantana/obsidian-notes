Pergunta 1Incorreto

Your new team member has been assigned to help you manage the code base for the new release of the stock trading application within your organization.  You are unsure how you were provided access to the code repository but would like to help your colleague get the appropriate access.  What is the best approach?

add your new team member directly to the GitHub repository

Resposta correta

reach out to the organization owner to view which teams have access to the repository and then have that owner or a team maintainer add your colleague to the appropriate team

instruct your colleague to contact GitHub support for access

Sua resposta está incorreta

reach out to the organization moderator to view which teams have access to the repository and then have them add your collegue to the appropriate team

Explicação geral

To perform any actions on GitHub a person must have sufficient access to the relevant account or resource. This access is controlled by permissions. A permission is the ability to perform a specific action. A role is a set of permissions you can assign to individuals or teams.  Teams allow you to manage access for people in an organization.  People with owner or team maintainer permissions can add organization members to teams to assign them their appropriate roles.

********************

**WRONG ANSWERS:**

- People with admin access to a repository can manage access to the repository, so while it may be possible to provide your team member access directly to the repository it is unclear if you have access to do so. In addition, adding a user directly without understanding the access process may lead to inappropriate permissions and security risks.
    
- While GitHub support can assist with certain issues, access to specific repositories is typically managed by repository owners or administrators. Relying solely on GitHub support may not be the most efficient approach for repository access.
    
- Organization moderators have access to block and unblock non-member contributors, set interaction limits, and hide comments in public repositories owned by the organization but they do not have access to assign members to teams.

Pergunta 2Incorreto

You have committed some code in your private repository but want to share it with a colleague for review and collaboration. Considering the situation, how can you easily share the code without giving your colleague direct access to your repository?

_s_hare the repository's clone URL and provide your colleague with the necessary credentials

Sua resposta está incorreta

fork your private repository and share the forked repository with your colleague

add your colleague as a collaborator to your private repository

Resposta correta

create a GitHub Gist for the code and share the Gist URL with your colleague

Explicação geral

Creating a GitHub Gist for the code and sharing the Gist URL with your colleague is the most suitable option. Gists allow you to share code snippets or files without granting access to the entire repository, making it ideal for review and collaboration.

********************

**WRONG ANSWERS:**

- Adding your colleague as a collaborator would grant them direct access to your private repository. This option doesn't align with the goal of sharing the code without providing direct repository access.
    
- Forking a private repository and sharing the forked repository would still give your colleague access to the entire codebase. This doesn't meet the requirement of sharing specific code without direct access to the repository.
    
- Sharing the repository's clone URL and credentials would give your colleague direct access to the entire repository. This approach does not align with the goal of sharing specific code only.

Pergunta 3Incorreto

Which of the following best describes a GitHub project?

a repository with individual files

Sua resposta está incorreta

a version control system for tracking changes in code

Resposta correta

a collaborative space to help manage code, track issues, and plan your work

a platform for hosting personal websites

Explicação geral

A GitHub project’s primary purpose is to be an adaptable spreadsheet, task board, and road map to integrate your issues and pull requests on Github. This allows groups of people to plan and track their work effectively.

********************

**WRONG ANSWERS:**

- GitHub projects do involve repositories, but they are not limited to individual files. Github projects usually comprise of large projects with multiple files and directories.
    
- While a person can use GitHub to host personal websites, it is not the main purpose of a GitHub project. GitHub projects are mainly for collaboration and managing code, issues, and work.
    
- GitHub does embody versional control through Git. The main purpose of a GitHub project is more than just a version control system. Projects on GitHub allow for collaboration, tracking issues, and management of code.

Who can use the Insights feature for Projects?

users with GitHub free or legacy plans

only users with admin access to a project

Resposta correta

users with write or admin access to a project

Sua resposta está incorreta

anyone who can view a project, regardless of access level

Explicação geral

The only users who can use the Insights feature for Projects are those with **write or admin access** to the specific project.

********************

**WRONG ANSWERS:**

- Being able to use the Insights feature does not have to do with the type of GitHub plan the user has, it just has to do with access levels to the project
    
- People with just viewing access cannot use the Insights feature since they do not have write or admin access on the project
    
- Although users with admin access can use Insights, it also includes users with write access

Domain 5 - Project Management

Pergunta 5Correto

What is the purpose of using project views in GitHub project management?

Sua resposta está correta

project views allow you to visualize and organize project tasks and issues across different boards, providing multiple perspectives on project progress

project views help customize the appearance of a project's README file

project views enable real-time collaboration on code editing within the GitHub repository

project views are used to set access permissions for team members in a GitHub project

Explicação geral

The main purpose of project views in GitHub project management is to allow users to visualize and organize project tasks and issues across different boards. This provides multiple perspectives on project progress and helps in effective project organization.

********************

**WRONG ANSWERS:**

- Project views are not primarily used to customize the appearance of a project's README file. They are more focused on project organization and visualization.
    
- Project views are unrelated to real-time collaboration on code editing within the GitHub repository. They are more about organizing and visualizing project tasks.
    
- Project views are not used to set access permissions for team members in a GitHub project. Access permissions are typically managed at the repository or organization level.

Dan found an interesting code repository that Sarah contributed to, which would help him save time on a project. As a result, Dan followed Sarah on GitHub. What benefits will Dan see by following a GitHub user?

be able to send a direct message to Sarah via GitHub Community

be listed in Sarah's dashboard as someone he is following.

automatically trigger an email to Sarah that he is a new follower.

Sua resposta está correta

be able to see Sarah's updates and activities in his personal dashboard.

Explicação geral

Once you star repositories or follow people, you will see updates on their activities on your personal dashboard.

********************

**WRONG ANSWERS:**

- GitHub does not default to automatically triggering emails for new followers
    
- GitHub does not connect followers for direct messaging
    
- Dan will be listed on Sarah's dashboard as a follower but not as someone he is following

Domain 7 - Benefits of the GitHub Community

Pergunta 7Correto

You and a colleague are collaborating to resolve a critical project issue. You want to receive email notifications of any comments or changes so you can address them promptly. How can you achieve this?

enable email notifications for the entire repository to stay informed about any updates

star the repository to receive enable notifications on any changes made within the repository

submit a merge request and link it to the issue

Sua resposta está correta

subscribe to the issue in GitHub to receive notifications about the latest comments

Explicação geral

To stay updated on the most recent comments in an issue, you can **subscribe to an issue to receive notifications** about the latest comments. This ensures you receive notifications specifically for the critical project issue you are collaborating on. To quickly find links to recently updated issues you're subscribed to, visit your dashboard.

********************  
**WRONG ANSWERS:**

- enabling email notifications for the entire repository might lead to information overload, as it would cover all activities within the repository.
    
- using the "Star" button on the repository would not result in email notifications for activity in the repo
    
- submitting a merge request and linking the issue would not be the correct process here as that's what you would do once that issue has been resolved

Which of the following is NOT a built-in metadata option to help build a richer view of item attributes?

Assignee

Labels

Sua resposta está incorreta

Milestone

Resposta correta

Timestamp

Explicação geral

Although a user could add a timestamp field, it is not one of the built-in metadata that GitHub provides. A user would have to add it to their project manually if it is needed in the type of project they are creating

********************

**WRONG ANSWERS:**

- Milestones are one of the built-in metadata that GitHub provides. They track progress on groups of issues or pull requests in a repository
    
- Labels are another built-in metadata that GitHub provides, they are used to classify issues, pull requests, and discussions
    
- Assignees are also a built-in metadata that GitHub provides

Pergunta 9Correto

You are participating in a GitHub discussion where comments have been made in response to a question. You've received a helpful response and want to highlight the comment to allow visitors to find the answer quickly. What action should you take?

instruct users to use discussion insights to find the answer

Sua resposta está correta

mark the comment as the answer to the discussion

create an issue and link the discussion

lock the discussion so it remains the last answer of the discussion

Explicação geral

You can mark a comment in the discussion as an answer to the discussion if a discussion is within a category that accepts answers. When you mark a question as an answer, GitHub will highlight the comment and replies to the comment to help visitors quickly find the answer.

********************  
**WRONG ANSWERS:**

- you don't need to lock the discussion. Additional comments may still allow others to ask additional questions or provide additional insight or tips for others. You should simply mark the comment as the answer.
    
- discussion insights will show data behind all of the discussions in the repo, not specific answers to questions. You should simply mark the comment as the answer.
    
- you don't need to create an issue and link the discussion. You should simply mark the comment as the answer.

Isabella wants to create a new branch for a pull request but does not have write permissions to the repository. How can she create a new branch in order to propose changes to the main branch?

clone the repository to her local machine and then create the branch

ask a friend to create the branch for her

Sua resposta está correta

fork the repository first

use the GitHub UI to create the branch instead of the command line

Explicação geral

If you want to create a new branch for your pull request and do not have write permissions to the repository, you can fork the repository first. Fork the repo, create the branch with proposed changes, and submit the pull request

********************  
**WRONG ANSWERS:**

- Cloning the repo would allow you to create the branch locally, but you would not be able to push the new branch since you don't have permission
    
- Changing to the GitHub UI wouldn't give you permission to create the branch
    
- Don't ask a friend to do it. Fork the repo, create the branch with proposed changes, and submit the pull request

You are reviewing a pull request on GitHub. The changes introduced seem promising, but you've identified a few areas that need improvement. What actions can you take to effectively contribute to the code review process? (select three)

Sua seleção está correta

provide suggestions for improvements before merging

Sua seleção está correta

request specific changes directly within the code

Sua seleção está incorreta

indicate overall approval and readiness for merging

Sua seleção está correta

comment on specific lines of code with detailed feedback

Explicação geral

You can **comment** on a pull request, **approve** the changes, or **request improvements** before approving.

You can review changes in a pull request one file at a time. While reviewing the files in a pull request, you can leave individual comments on specific changes. After you finish reviewing each file, you can mark the file as viewed. This collapses the file, helping you identify the files you still need to review. A progress bar in the pull request header shows the number of files you've viewed. After reviewing as many files as you want, you can approve the pull request or **request additional changes** by submitting your review with a summary comment.

********************

**WRONG ANSWER:**

- While approving is a valid action, it is not suitable in this scenario where areas of improvement have been identified. Approving is more appropriate when you believe the changes are ready for merging without any concerns.

Projects has a less customizable interface compared to Projects Classic

Projects has a fixed and non-customizable user interface

Sua resposta está correta

Projects provides more flexibility in customizing project boards and workflows

Both Projects and Projects Classic share the same user interface

Explicação geral

Projects offers more customizable options for project boards and workflows compared to Projects Classic. Projects allows users to adjust the experience to their specific needs making it better for tracking progress and organizing issues and pull requests.

********************

**WRONG ANSWERS:**

- Projects actually have a more customizable interface than Projects Classic
    
- Projects and Projects Classic do not share the same user interface. Projects Classic is simpler while Projects has more features and is more advanced
    
- Projects do not have a fixed and non-customizable user interface. Projects have many customizable options to better organize the groups projects issues, pull requests, and draft issues

Pergunta 13Correto

What type of file is used to define a workflow in GitHub Actions?

Markdown file

Sua resposta está correta

YAML file

JSON file

CSV file

Explicação geral

GitHub uses YAML because it is a commonly used, human-readable data serialization format. Its flexibility and many different use cases are why GitHub chose YAML.

********************

**WRONG ANSWERS:**

- Markdown is a lightweight markup language used for text formatting. While there are markdown files on GitHub, they are not used to define workflows. However, you can use them to document the functions of your workflow and YAML file.
    
- GitHub Actions workflows are not defined using a CSV file because CSV files are used for data storage.
    
- JSON files are used for scripting or temporary data storage.

Ned wants to give users easy access to important or frequently used repositories within his organization. What organizational setting can he use to achieve this?

GitHub CoPilot

GitHub Discussions

GitHub repository insights

Sua resposta está correta

pinned repositories

Explicação geral

You can give users easy access to important or frequently used repositories, by choosing up to six repositories for public users and six repositories for members of the organization. Once you pin repositories to your organization profile, the "Pinned" section is shown above the "Repositories" section of the profile page.

********************

**WRONG ANSWERS:**

- Enabling GitHub Discussions is not directly related to giving users easy access to important or frequently used repositories. GitHub Discussions is a feature that provides a space for community discussion within a repository but doesn't affect the visibility or accessibility of repositories on the organization's main page.
    
- GitHub Insights is not a specific feature or setting related to giving users easy access to frequently used repositories. GitHub Repository Insights provides analytics and visualizations related to repository activity but does not impact the visibility or accessibility of repositories on the organization's main page.
    
- GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered code completion tool and does not affect the visibility or accessibility of repositories on the organization's main page.

Jack would like to disable GitHub Actions on his repository. What is the result of doing so?

Sua resposta está incorreta

you cannot disable GitHub Actions on a repository

Resposta correta

no workflows run on the repository

Explicação geral

You can disable GitHub Actions for your repository altogether. When you disable GitHub Actions, no workflows run in your repository.

********************

**WRONG ANSWERS:**

- By default, GitHub Actions is enabled on all repositories and organizations. You can choose to disable GitHub Actions or limit it to actions and reusable workflows in your organization.
    
- You can disable GitHub Actions for your repository altogether. When you disable GitHub Actions, no workflows run in your repository.  Alternatively, you can enable GitHub Actions in your repository but limit the actions and reusable workflows a workflow can run.
    
- By default, when you create a new repository in your personal account, workflows are not allowed to create or approve pull requests. If you create a new repository in an organization, the setting is inherited from what is configured in the organization settings.

Bryan is a content creator and wants to offer students hands-on experience using codespaces. How can he share codespace links directly to a browser?

instruct students to manually create Codespaces by navigating to the GitHub repository's main page

provide instructions for installing the GitHub CLI and using specific commands to initiate Codespaces creation

ask students to clone the repository and set up Codespaces individually based on their preferences

Sua resposta está correta

share a deep link in the course materials that, when clicked, opens a pre-configured Codespace in the browser

Explicação geral

You can make it easy for people to work on your repository in a codespace by providing a link to the codespace creation page. You can add a link to take people straight to a page for creating a codespace, with your choice of options preconfigured. Alternatively you can link to the "Resume codespace" page.

********************  
**WRONG ANSWERS:**

- Instructing students to manually create Codespaces by navigating to the GitHub repository's main page is not the most efficient way to provide hands-on experience.
    
- Asking students to clone the repository and set up Codespaces individually introduces unnecessary complexity and manual steps.
    
- Providing instructions for installing the GitHub CLI and using specific commands adds complexity and might be challenging for students, especially beginners.

You are looking through issues on a project so you can contribute but are unsure if anyone is working on an issue. What GitHub feature can your team use to better inform other team members about who is working on an issue?

Resposta correta

link a pull request or branch to an issue to show that a fix is in progress

Sua resposta está incorreta

filter, sort, and search issues and pull requests that are relevant to the repository

close the issue and wait for other team members to alert you that they were working on it

send a message to the collaborators and ask them what issues they are working on

Explicação geral

You can link a pull request or branch to an issue to show that a fix is in progress and to automatically close the issue when the pull request or branch is merged. You can link an issue to a pull request manually or using a supported keyword in the pull request description. When you link a pull request to the issue the pull request addresses, collaborators can see that someone is working on the issue.

When you merge a linked pull request into the default branch of a repository, its linked issue is automatically closed.

********************  
**WRONG ANSWERS:**

- filtering issues and pull requests probably won't provide additional information if there are no additional detains in the issues that signify that somebody is working on it. Team members should link a PR or branch to the issue instead.
    
- sending an email isn't very collaborative and isn't even a GitHub feature. Team members should link a PR or branch to the issue instead.
    
- closing the issue would alert the users that created the issue and it might upset them since they might think the issue isn't important. Team members should link a PR or branch to the issue instead.

license

Sua seleção está correta

language

Explicação geral

GitHub topics all you to explore repositories in a particular subject area, find projects to contribute to, and discover new solutions to a specific problem.  Helpful topics to classify a repository include the repository's intended purpose, subject area, community, or language. Additionally, GitHub analyzes public repository content and generates suggested topics that repository admins can accept or reject. Private repository content is not analyzed and does not receive topic suggestions.

********************

**WRONG ANSWER:**

- GitHub topics don't typically include license information.  Most people place their license text in a file named `LICENSE.txt` (or `LICENSE.md` or `LICENSE.rst`) in the root of the repository

What is the primary purpose of a Version Control System (VCS)?

a system designed to execute source code developed by its users

a solution to automatically fix coding errors or issues within files from multiple developers

an app used by organizations to enforce code quality standards

Sua resposta está correta

a program or service used to track changes to a collection of files in a collaborative environment

Explicação geral

A Version Control System (VCS) is a tool that **helps manage changes to source code, documents, and other files in a collaborative environment**. It allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously by tracking changes made to the files over time. VCS provides features such as version history, branching, and merging, which help maintain a structured development process, reduce conflicts, and enable efficient collaboration. The main goal is to ensure that changes can be tracked, reverted if necessary, and integrated seamlessly into the project, promoting a systematic and organized approach to software development.

****************

**Wrong Answers:**

- VCS is not used to enforce code quality standards, as that is usually done using a different app or service
    
- VCS does not execute source code. It is designed to store different versions of the code or files
    
- VCS will not automatically fix coding errors or issues in files - it only stores the files

GitHub Action

GitHub Issue

GitHub Gist

Sua resposta está correta

GitHub Repository Template

Explicação geral

You can make an existing repository a template, so you and others can generate new repositories with the same directory structure, branches, and files.

********************

**WRONG ANSWERS:**

- GitHub Gists are used for sharing snippets or small pieces of code but are not suitable for defining a full repository structure.
    
- GitHub Issues are for tracking tasks, bugs, and discussions, not for creating a standardized repository structure.
    
- GitHub Actions are used for automating workflows, continuous integration, and deployment, but they do not define repository structure.

What feature can developers take advantage of by using the GitHub Marketplace?

Resposta correta

the ability to publish and share their GitHub Actions and Apps

a single place to connect, follow, and chat with other members of the GitHub community

a single place to manage their GitHub subscription, purchase additional GitHub Actions storage and minutes and access GitHub Apps

Sua resposta está incorreta

a storefront for anyone to sell their GitHub Apps to others

Explicação geral

The GitHub Marketplace allows developers to share **GitHub Actions** and **Apps** with the GitHub community.

****************

**WRONG ANSWERS:**

- The primary intention of the GitHub Marketplace is to list free and paid tools for developers to use.  It is not a single place to connect and follow members of the GitHub community.
    
- Anyone can share their apps with other users for free on GitHub Marketplace, but only apps owned by organizations can sell their apps.
    
- GitHub Marketplace offers developers two types of tools: GitHub Actions and Apps.  Managing GitHub subscriptions, GitHub Actions storage, and minutes are not provided within the GitHub Marketplace.

Pergunta 24Incorreto

Whenever you work in a GitHub codespace, what type of machine are you working on?

a virtual machine running on your local hardware

Sua resposta está incorreta

a virtual machine running in your own Microsoft Azure account

Resposta correta

a dev container running on a virtual machine managed by GitHub

a local machine running GitHub Desktop

Explicação geral

Development containers, or dev containers, are Docker containers that are specifically configured to provide a fully featured development environment. Whenever you work in a codespace, you are using a dev container on a virtual machine.

********************  
**WRONG ANSWERS:**

- Codespaces are not based on a dedicated machine physically connected to your computer. They are cloud-hosted, allowing for remote development.
    
- Codespaces are cloud-based, and you are not working on a local machine running GitHub Desktop. Codespaces provide a remote development environment accessible from your browser.
    
- While Codespaces do run in Azure, they are managed by GitHub and don't run in your own account

Domain 4 - Modern Development

Pergunta 25Correto

When working with GitHub repositories, what is the purpose of cloning a repository to your local machine?

cloning enables you to fetch only the latest changes and the main branch from GitHub.com, making it efficient for quick updates without downloading the entire repository.

Sua resposta está correta

cloning allows you to copy the entire repository from GitHub.com to your local machine or codespace

cloning is necessary only for creating backup copies of a repository and does not directly support collaborative development

cloning allows you to create a new, entirely separate repository for personal use, providing isolation from the original project.

Explicação geral

Cloning allows you to copy the entire repository from GitHub.com to your local machine or codespace, providing a full version history and enabling contributions to the project. This process facilitates collaboration by allowing contributors to work locally and make changes before pushing them to the remote repository.

********************

**WRONG ANSWERS:**

- Cloning is not meant to create entirely separate repositories. Instead, it is intended to replicate the existing project for collaborative development, ensuring contributors have a synchronized copy of the project.
    
- Cloning does not fetch only the latest changes but pulls down a full copy of all repository data. It provides a comprehensive snapshot of the project's current state, not just the latest updates.
    
- Cloning is not necessary only for creating backups. Its primary purpose is to support collaborative development by providing a local copy of the repository for contributors to work on and contribute changes.

What can be determined based on the following CODEOWNERS file?  

1. *.tf   @acme/infrastructure
2. /docs/ @dani

Sua resposta está correta

changes to files in the `docs` folder need to be reviewed by the GitHub user `dani` for a pull-request

review assignments are assigned by placing this CODEOWNERS file in the `owners` folder within the repository

changes to files with the `tf` extension need to be reviewed by the `infrastructure` user

the GitHub user `dani` has code ownership for all individual commits made in the `docs` folder

Explicação geral

Changes to files in the `docs` folder need to be reviewed by the user `dani`.  A CODEOWNERS file uses a pattern that follows most of the same rules used in [gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore#_pattern_format) files. The pattern is followed by one or more GitHub usernames or team names using the standard `@username` or `@org/team-name` format.
