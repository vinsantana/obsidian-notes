Your new team member has been assigned to help you manage the code base for the new release of the stock trading application within your organization.  You are unsure how you were provided access to the code repository but would like to help your colleague get the appropriate access.  What is the best approach?

add your new team member directly to the GitHub repository

Resposta correta
reach out to the organization owner to view which teams have access to the repository and then have that owner or a team maintainer add your colleague to the appropriate team

instruct your colleague to contact GitHub support for access

Sua resposta está incorreta
reach out to the organization moderator to view which teams have access to the repository and then have them add your collegue to the appropriate team

Explicação geral
To perform any actions on GitHub a person must have sufficient access to the relevant account or resource. This access is controlled by permissions. A permission is the ability to perform a specific action. A role is a set of permissions you can assign to individuals or teams.  Teams allow you to manage access for people in an organization.  People with owner or team maintainer permissions can add organization members to teams to assign them their appropriate roles.

****************

WRONG ANSWERS:

People with admin access to a repository can manage access to the repository, so while it may be possible to provide your team member access directly to the repository it is unclear if you have access to do so. In addition, adding a user directly without understanding the access process may lead to inappropriate permissions and security risks.

While GitHub support can assist with certain issues, access to specific repositories is typically managed by repository owners or administrators. Relying solely on GitHub support may not be the most efficient approach for repository access.

Organization moderators have access to block and unblock non-member contributors, set interaction limits, and hide comments in public repositories owned by the organization but they do not have access to assign members to teams.

You have committed some code in your private repository but want to share it with a colleague for review and collaboration. Considering the situation, how can you easily share the code without giving your colleague direct access to your repository?

share the repository's clone URL and provide your colleague with the necessary credentials

Sua resposta está incorreta
fork your private repository and share the forked repository with your colleague

add your colleague as a collaborator to your private repository

Resposta correta
create a GitHub Gist for the code and share the Gist URL with your colleague

Explicação geral
Creating a GitHub Gist for the code and sharing the Gist URL with your colleague is the most suitable option. Gists allow you to share code snippets or files without granting access to the entire repository, making it ideal for review and collaboration.

********************

WRONG ANSWERS:

Adding your colleague as a collaborator would grant them direct access to your private repository. This option doesn't align with the goal of sharing the code without providing direct repository access.

Forking a private repository and sharing the forked repository would still give your colleague access to the entire codebase. This doesn't meet the requirement of sharing specific code without direct access to the repository.

Sharing the repository's clone URL and credentials would give your colleague direct access to the entire repository. This approach does not align with the goal of sharing specific code only.

Which of the following best describes a GitHub project?

a repository with individual files

Sua resposta está incorreta
a version control system for tracking changes in code

Resposta correta
a collaborative space to help manage code, track issues, and plan your work

a platform for hosting personal websites

Explicação geral
A GitHub project’s primary purpose is to be an adaptable spreadsheet, task board, and road map to integrate your issues and pull requests on Github. This allows groups of people to plan and track their work effectively.

********************

WRONG ANSWERS:

GitHub projects do involve repositories, but they are not limited to individual files. Github projects usually comprise of large projects with multiple files and directories.

While a person can use GitHub to host personal websites, it is not the main purpose of a GitHub project. GitHub projects are mainly for collaboration and managing code, issues, and work.

GitHub does embody versional control through Git. The main purpose of a GitHub project is more than just a version control system. Projects on GitHub allow for collaboration, tracking issues, and management of code.

Explicação geral
The only users who can use the Insights feature for Projects are those with write or admin access to the specific project.

What is the purpose of using project views in GitHub project management?

Sua resposta está correta
project views allow you to visualize and organize project tasks and issues across different boards, providing multiple perspectives on project progress

project views help customize the appearance of a project's README file

project views enable real-time collaboration on code editing within the GitHub repository

project views are used to set access permissions for team members in a GitHub project

Explicação geral
The main purpose of project views in GitHub project management is to allow users to visualize and organize project tasks and issues across different boards. This provides multiple perspectives on project progress and helps in effective project organization.

********************

WRONG ANSWERS:

Project views are not primarily used to customize the appearance of a project's README file. They are more focused on project organization and visualization.

Project views are unrelated to real-time collaboration on code editing within the GitHub repository. They are more about organizing and visualizing project tasks.

Project views are not used to set access permissions for team members in a GitHub project. Access permissions are typically managed at the repository or organization level.

You and a colleague are collaborating to resolve a critical project issue. You want to receive email notifications of any comments or changes so you can address them promptly. How can you achieve this?

enable email notifications for the entire repository to stay informed about any updates

star the repository to receive enable notifications on any changes made within the repository

submit a merge request and link it to the issue

Sua resposta está correta
subscribe to the issue in GitHub to receive notifications about the latest comments

Explicação geral
To stay updated on the most recent comments in an issue, you can subscribe to an issue to receive notifications about the latest comments. This ensures you receive notifications specifically for the critical project issue you are collaborating on. To quickly find links to recently updated issues you're subscribed to, visit your dashboard.

********************
WRONG ANSWERS:

enabling email notifications for the entire repository might lead to information overload, as it would cover all activities within the repository.

using the "Star" button on the repository would not result in email notifications for activity in the repo

submitting a merge request and linking the issue would not be the correct process here as that's what you would do once that issue has been resolved

Explicação geral
You can mark a comment in the discussion as an answer to the discussion if a discussion is within a category that accepts answers. When you mark a question as an answer, GitHub will highlight the comment and replies to the comment to help visitors quickly find the answer.

********************
WRONG ANSWERS:

you don't need to lock the discussion. Additional comments may still allow others to ask additional questions or provide additional insight or tips for others. You should simply mark the comment as the answer.

Explicação geral
You can comment on a pull request, approve the changes, or request improvements before approving.

You can review changes in a pull request one file at a time. While reviewing the files in a pull request, you can leave individual comments on specific changes. After you finish reviewing each file, you can mark the file as viewed. This collapses the file, helping you identify the files you still need to review. A progress bar in the pull request header shows the number of files you've viewed. After reviewing as many files as you want, you can approve the pull request or request additional changes by submitting your review with a summary comment.

********************

WRONG ANSWER:

While approving is a valid action, it is not suitable in this scenario where areas of improvement have been identified. Approving is more appropriate when you believe the changes are ready for merging without any concerns.

WRONG ANSWERS:

Markdown is a lightweight markup language used for text formatting. While there are markdown files on GitHub, they are not used to define workflows. However, you can use them to document the functions of your workflow and YAML file.

GitHub Actions workflows are not defined using a CSV file because CSV files are used for data storage.

Resposta correta
link a pull request or branch to an issue to show that a fix is in progress

Sua resposta está incorreta
filter, sort, and search issues and pull requests that are relevant to the repository

close the issue and wait for other team members to alert you that they were working on it

send a message to the collaborators and ask them what issues they are working on

Explicação geral
You can link a pull request or branch to an issue to show that a fix is in progress and to automatically close the issue when the pull request or branch is merged. You can link an issue to a pull request manually or using a supported keyword in the pull request description. When you link a pull request to the issue the pull request addresses, collaborators can see that someone is working on the issue.

When you merge a linked pull request into the default branch of a repository, its linked issue is automatically closed.

********************
WRONG ANSWERS:

filtering issues and pull requests probably won't provide additional information if there are no additional detains in the issues that signify that somebody is working on it. Team members should link a PR or branch to the issue instead.

sending an email isn't very collaborative and isn't even a GitHub feature. Team members should link a PR or branch to the issue instead.

closing the issue would alert the users that created the issue and it might upset them since they might think the issue isn't important. Team members should link a PR or branch to the issue instead.

a solution to automatically fix coding errors or issues within files from multiple developers

an app used by organizations to enforce code quality standards

Sua resposta está correta
a program or service used to track changes to a collection of files in a collaborative environment

Explicação geral
A Version Control System (VCS) is a tool that helps manage changes to source code, documents, and other files in a collaborative environment. It allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously by tracking changes made to the files over time. VCS provides features such as version history, branching, and merging, which help maintain a structured development process, reduce conflicts, and enable efficient collaboration. The main goal is to ensure that changes can be tracked, reverted if necessary, and integrated seamlessly into the project, promoting a systematic and organized approach to software development.

VCS is not used to enforce code quality standards, as that is usually done using a different app or service

VCS does not execute source code. It is designed to store different versions of the code or files
