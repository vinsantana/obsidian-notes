The github.dev editor introduces a lightweight editing experience that runs entirely in your browser. With the github.dev editor, you can navigate files and source code repositories from GitHub, and make and commit code changes. You can open any repository, fork, or pull request in the editor.

The github.dev editor is available to everyone for free on GitHub.com.

The github.dev editor provides many of the benefits of Visual Studio Code, such as search, syntax highlighting, and a source control view. You can also use Settings Sync to share your own VS Code settings with the editor. See "[Settings Sync](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/settings-sync)" in the VS Code documentation.
