A region in Azure is made up of multiple datacenters located within a specific area, chosen for low-latency connections and linked through a specialized network. All Azure resources are created within an Azure region and subscription.
These globally distributed regions offer different levels of availability and redundancy. Each region is paired with at least one other for disaster recovery purposes.
