Multi-tenant architecture is a design approach that enables multiple user groups — referred to as tenants — access to one instance of an application or system. This is much like an apartment building, where various tenants have their own apartments. All the apartments are private and secure but share the same infrastructure.

This type of architecture enables companies to save money on infrastructure costs by using the same hardware resources for several instances of the same application for multiple tenants. It is especially beneficial for SaaS companies because it allows them to scale their applications and remain cost-effective.
