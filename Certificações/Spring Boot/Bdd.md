We start by collaboratively _**[[discovering]]**_ the scope of the behaviour required by the story. Once we have agreed on that behaviour, we [[**_formulate]]_** the specification in business-readable language. Finally, we [[**_automate]]_** the formulated specification to verify that the system actually behaves as expected.

BDD is a collaborative activity. Living documentation is a secondary, valuable, output of applying BDD practices.

[[User stories]] were created to be "placeholders for a conversation." They allow us to defer detailed analysis until we're confident that the behaviour they describe actually needs to be developed.

[[Gherkin]] is a simple syntax that allows teams to write business readable, executable specifications. 

Some of the Gherkin keywords are **_Given, When,_** and **_Then_**, but not all text that uses these words is Gherkin.

Gherkin is understood by a large number of tools, notably Cucumber and Specflow, that effectively turn the specification into automated tests.

During three amigos the team uses concrete examples to ensure that they have a shared understanding of the functionality they're about to develop. Those concrete examples are **_formulated_** into Gherkin scenarios.

So, each scenario is an example.

Scenario and Example are both keywords in Gherkin.
