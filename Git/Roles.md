To perform any actions on GitHub a person must have sufficient access to the relevant account or resource. This access is controlled by permissions. A permission is the ability to perform a specific action. **A role is a set of permissions** you can assign to individuals or teams.  Teams allow you to manage access for people in an organization.  People with [[owner]] or [[team maintainer]] permissions can add organization members to teams to assign them their appropriate roles.
