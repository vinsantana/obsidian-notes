Pergunta 1Incorreto

Your new team member has been assigned to help you manage the code base for the new release of the stock trading application within your organization.  You are unsure how you were provided access to the code repository but would like to help your colleague get the appropriate access.  What is the best approach?

add your new team member directly to the GitHub repository

Resposta correta

reach out to the organization owner to view which teams have access to the repository and then have that owner or a team maintainer add your colleague to the appropriate team

instruct your colleague to contact GitHub support for access

Sua resposta está incorreta

reach out to the organization moderator to view which teams have access to the repository and then have them add your collegue to the appropriate team

Explicação geral

To perform any actions on GitHub a person must have sufficient access to the relevant account or resource. This access is controlled by permissions. A permission is the ability to perform a specific action. A role is a set of permissions you can assign to individuals or teams.  Teams allow you to manage access for people in an organization.  People with owner or team maintainer permissions can add organization members to teams to assign them their appropriate roles.

********************

**WRONG ANSWERS:**

- People with admin access to a repository can manage access to the repository, so while it may be possible to provide your team member access directly to the repository it is unclear if you have access to do so. In addition, adding a user directly without understanding the access process may lead to inappropriate permissions and security risks.
    
- While GitHub support can assist with certain issues, access to specific repositories is typically managed by repository owners or administrators. Relying solely on GitHub support may not be the most efficient approach for repository access.
    
- Organization moderators have access to block and unblock non-member contributors, set interaction limits, and hide comments in public repositories owned by the organization but they do not have access to assign members to teams.

Pergunta 2Incorreto

You have committed some code in your private repository but want to share it with a colleague for review and collaboration. Considering the situation, how can you easily share the code without giving your colleague direct access to your repository?

_s_hare the repository's clone URL and provide your colleague with the necessary credentials

Sua resposta está incorreta

fork your private repository and share the forked repository with your colleague

add your colleague as a collaborator to your private repository

Resposta correta

create a GitHub Gist for the code and share the Gist URL with your colleague

Explicação geral

Creating a GitHub Gist for the code and sharing the Gist URL with your colleague is the most suitable option. Gists allow you to share code snippets or files without granting access to the entire repository, making it ideal for review and collaboration.

********************

**WRONG ANSWERS:**

- Adding your colleague as a collaborator would grant them direct access to your private repository. This option doesn't align with the goal of sharing the code without providing direct repository access.
    
- Forking a private repository and sharing the forked repository would still give your colleague access to the entire codebase. This doesn't meet the requirement of sharing specific code without direct access to the repository.
    
- Sharing the repository's clone URL and credentials would give your colleague direct access to the entire repository. This approach does not align with the goal of sharing specific code only.

Pergunta 3Incorreto

Which of the following best describes a GitHub project?

a repository with individual files

Sua resposta está incorreta

a version control system for tracking changes in code

Resposta correta

a collaborative space to help manage code, track issues, and plan your work

a platform for hosting personal websites

Explicação geral

A GitHub project’s primary purpose is to be an adaptable spreadsheet, task board, and road map to integrate your issues and pull requests on Github. This allows groups of people to plan and track their work effectively.

********************

**WRONG ANSWERS:**

- GitHub projects do involve repositories, but they are not limited to individual files. Github projects usually comprise of large projects with multiple files and directories.
    
- While a person can use GitHub to host personal websites, it is not the main purpose of a GitHub project. GitHub projects are mainly for collaboration and managing code, issues, and work.
    
- GitHub does embody versional control through Git. The main purpose of a GitHub project is more than just a version control system. Projects on GitHub allow for collaboration, tracking issues, and management of code.

Who can use the Insights feature for Projects?

users with GitHub free or legacy plans

only users with admin access to a project

Resposta correta

users with write or admin access to a project

Sua resposta está incorreta

anyone who can view a project, regardless of access level

Explicação geral

The only users who can use the Insights feature for Projects are those with **write or admin access** to the specific project.

********************

**WRONG ANSWERS:**

- Being able to use the Insights feature does not have to do with the type of GitHub plan the user has, it just has to do with access levels to the project
    
- People with just viewing access cannot use the Insights feature since they do not have write or admin access on the project
    
- Although users with admin access can use Insights, it also includes users with write access

Domain 5 - Project Management

Pergunta 5Correto

What is the purpose of using project views in GitHub project management?

Sua resposta está correta

project views allow you to visualize and organize project tasks and issues across different boards, providing multiple perspectives on project progress

project views help customize the appearance of a project's README file

project views enable real-time collaboration on code editing within the GitHub repository

project views are used to set access permissions for team members in a GitHub project

Explicação geral

The main purpose of project views in GitHub project management is to allow users to visualize and organize project tasks and issues across different boards. This provides multiple perspectives on project progress and helps in effective project organization.

********************

**WRONG ANSWERS:**

- Project views are not primarily used to customize the appearance of a project's README file. They are more focused on project organization and visualization.
    
- Project views are unrelated to real-time collaboration on code editing within the GitHub repository. They are more about organizing and visualizing project tasks.
    
- Project views are not used to set access permissions for team members in a GitHub project. Access permissions are typically managed at the repository or organization level.

Dan found an interesting code repository that Sarah contributed to, which would help him save time on a project. As a result, Dan followed Sarah on GitHub. What benefits will Dan see by following a GitHub user?

be able to send a direct message to Sarah via GitHub Community

be listed in Sarah's dashboard as someone he is following.

automatically trigger an email to Sarah that he is a new follower.

Sua resposta está correta

be able to see Sarah's updates and activities in his personal dashboard.

Explicação geral

Once you star repositories or follow people, you will see updates on their activities on your personal dashboard.

********************

**WRONG ANSWERS:**

- GitHub does not default to automatically triggering emails for new followers
    
- GitHub does not connect followers for direct messaging
    
- Dan will be listed on Sarah's dashboard as a follower but not as someone he is following

Domain 7 - Benefits of the GitHub Community

Pergunta 7Correto

You and a colleague are collaborating to resolve a critical project issue. You want to receive email notifications of any comments or changes so you can address them promptly. How can you achieve this?

enable email notifications for the entire repository to stay informed about any updates

star the repository to receive enable notifications on any changes made within the repository

submit a merge request and link it to the issue

Sua resposta está correta

subscribe to the issue in GitHub to receive notifications about the latest comments

Explicação geral

To stay updated on the most recent comments in an issue, you can **subscribe to an issue to receive notifications** about the latest comments. This ensures you receive notifications specifically for the critical project issue you are collaborating on. To quickly find links to recently updated issues you're subscribed to, visit your dashboard.

********************  
**WRONG ANSWERS:**

- enabling email notifications for the entire repository might lead to information overload, as it would cover all activities within the repository.
    
- using the "Star" button on the repository would not result in email notifications for activity in the repo
    
- submitting a merge request and linking the issue would not be the correct process here as that's what you would do once that issue has been resolved

Which of the following is NOT a built-in metadata option to help build a richer view of item attributes?

Assignee

Labels

Sua resposta está incorreta

Milestone

Resposta correta

Timestamp

Explicação geral

Although a user could add a timestamp field, it is not one of the built-in metadata that GitHub provides. A user would have to add it to their project manually if it is needed in the type of project they are creating

********************

**WRONG ANSWERS:**

- Milestones are one of the built-in metadata that GitHub provides. They track progress on groups of issues or pull requests in a repository
    
- Labels are another built-in metadata that GitHub provides, they are used to classify issues, pull requests, and discussions
    
- Assignees are also a built-in metadata that GitHub provides

Pergunta 9Correto

You are participating in a GitHub discussion where comments have been made in response to a question. You've received a helpful response and want to highlight the comment to allow visitors to find the answer quickly. What action should you take?

instruct users to use discussion insights to find the answer

Sua resposta está correta

mark the comment as the answer to the discussion

create an issue and link the discussion

lock the discussion so it remains the last answer of the discussion

Explicação geral

You can mark a comment in the discussion as an answer to the discussion if a discussion is within a category that accepts answers. When you mark a question as an answer, GitHub will highlight the comment and replies to the comment to help visitors quickly find the answer.

********************  
**WRONG ANSWERS:**

- you don't need to lock the discussion. Additional comments may still allow others to ask additional questions or provide additional insight or tips for others. You should simply mark the comment as the answer.
    
- discussion insights will show data behind all of the discussions in the repo, not specific answers to questions. You should simply mark the comment as the answer.
    
- you don't need to create an issue and link the discussion. You should simply mark the comment as the answer.

Isabella wants to create a new branch for a pull request but does not have write permissions to the repository. How can she create a new branch in order to propose changes to the main branch?

clone the repository to her local machine and then create the branch

ask a friend to create the branch for her

Sua resposta está correta

fork the repository first

use the GitHub UI to create the branch instead of the command line

Explicação geral

If you want to create a new branch for your pull request and do not have write permissions to the repository, you can fork the repository first. Fork the repo, create the branch with proposed changes, and submit the pull request

********************  
**WRONG ANSWERS:**

- Cloning the repo would allow you to create the branch locally, but you would not be able to push the new branch since you don't have permission
    
- Changing to the GitHub UI wouldn't give you permission to create the branch
    
- Don't ask a friend to do it. Fork the repo, create the branch with proposed changes, and submit the pull request

You are reviewing a pull request on GitHub. The changes introduced seem promising, but you've identified a few areas that need improvement. What actions can you take to effectively contribute to the code review process? (select three)

Sua seleção está correta

provide suggestions for improvements before merging

Sua seleção está correta

request specific changes directly within the code

Sua seleção está incorreta

indicate overall approval and readiness for merging

Sua seleção está correta

comment on specific lines of code with detailed feedback

Explicação geral

You can **comment** on a pull request, **approve** the changes, or **request improvements** before approving.

You can review changes in a pull request one file at a time. While reviewing the files in a pull request, you can leave individual comments on specific changes. After you finish reviewing each file, you can mark the file as viewed. This collapses the file, helping you identify the files you still need to review. A progress bar in the pull request header shows the number of files you've viewed. After reviewing as many files as you want, you can approve the pull request or **request additional changes** by submitting your review with a summary comment.

********************

**WRONG ANSWER:**

- While approving is a valid action, it is not suitable in this scenario where areas of improvement have been identified. Approving is more appropriate when you believe the changes are ready for merging without any concerns.

Projects has a less customizable interface compared to Projects Classic

Projects has a fixed and non-customizable user interface

Sua resposta está correta

Projects provides more flexibility in customizing project boards and workflows

Both Projects and Projects Classic share the same user interface

Explicação geral

Projects offers more customizable options for project boards and workflows compared to Projects Classic. Projects allows users to adjust the experience to their specific needs making it better for tracking progress and organizing issues and pull requests.

********************

**WRONG ANSWERS:**

- Projects actually have a more customizable interface than Projects Classic
    
- Projects and Projects Classic do not share the same user interface. Projects Classic is simpler while Projects has more features and is more advanced
    
- Projects do not have a fixed and non-customizable user interface. Projects have many customizable options to better organize the groups projects issues, pull requests, and draft issues

Pergunta 13Correto

What type of file is used to define a workflow in GitHub Actions?

Markdown file

Sua resposta está correta

YAML file

JSON file

CSV file

Explicação geral

GitHub uses YAML because it is a commonly used, human-readable data serialization format. Its flexibility and many different use cases are why GitHub chose YAML.

********************

**WRONG ANSWERS:**

- Markdown is a lightweight markup language used for text formatting. While there are markdown files on GitHub, they are not used to define workflows. However, you can use them to document the functions of your workflow and YAML file.
    
- GitHub Actions workflows are not defined using a CSV file because CSV files are used for data storage.
    
- JSON files are used for scripting or temporary data storage.

Ned wants to give users easy access to important or frequently used repositories within his organization. What organizational setting can he use to achieve this?

GitHub CoPilot

GitHub Discussions

GitHub repository insights

Sua resposta está correta

pinned repositories

Explicação geral

You can give users easy access to important or frequently used repositories, by choosing up to six repositories for public users and six repositories for members of the organization. Once you pin repositories to your organization profile, the "Pinned" section is shown above the "Repositories" section of the profile page.

********************

**WRONG ANSWERS:**

- Enabling GitHub Discussions is not directly related to giving users easy access to important or frequently used repositories. GitHub Discussions is a feature that provides a space for community discussion within a repository but doesn't affect the visibility or accessibility of repositories on the organization's main page.
    
- GitHub Insights is not a specific feature or setting related to giving users easy access to frequently used repositories. GitHub Repository Insights provides analytics and visualizations related to repository activity but does not impact the visibility or accessibility of repositories on the organization's main page.
    
- GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered code completion tool and does not affect the visibility or accessibility of repositories on the organization's main page.

Jack would like to disable GitHub Actions on his repository. What is the result of doing so?

Sua resposta está incorreta

you cannot disable GitHub Actions on a repository

Resposta correta

no workflows run on the repository

Explicação geral

You can disable GitHub Actions for your repository altogether. When you disable GitHub Actions, no workflows run in your repository.

********************

**WRONG ANSWERS:**

- By default, GitHub Actions is enabled on all repositories and organizations. You can choose to disable GitHub Actions or limit it to actions and reusable workflows in your organization.
    
- You can disable GitHub Actions for your repository altogether. When you disable GitHub Actions, no workflows run in your repository.  Alternatively, you can enable GitHub Actions in your repository but limit the actions and reusable workflows a workflow can run.
    
- By default, when you create a new repository in your personal account, workflows are not allowed to create or approve pull requests. If you create a new repository in an organization, the setting is inherited from what is configured in the organization settings.

Bryan is a content creator and wants to offer students hands-on experience using codespaces. How can he share codespace links directly to a browser?

instruct students to manually create Codespaces by navigating to the GitHub repository's main page

provide instructions for installing the GitHub CLI and using specific commands to initiate Codespaces creation

ask students to clone the repository and set up Codespaces individually based on their preferences

Sua resposta está correta

share a deep link in the course materials that, when clicked, opens a pre-configured Codespace in the browser

Explicação geral

You can make it easy for people to work on your repository in a codespace by providing a link to the codespace creation page. You can add a link to take people straight to a page for creating a codespace, with your choice of options preconfigured. Alternatively you can link to the "Resume codespace" page.

********************  
**WRONG ANSWERS:**

- Instructing students to manually create Codespaces by navigating to the GitHub repository's main page is not the most efficient way to provide hands-on experience.
    
- Asking students to clone the repository and set up Codespaces individually introduces unnecessary complexity and manual steps.
    
- Providing instructions for installing the GitHub CLI and using specific commands adds complexity and might be challenging for students, especially beginners.

You are looking through issues on a project so you can contribute but are unsure if anyone is working on an issue. What GitHub feature can your team use to better inform other team members about who is working on an issue?

Resposta correta

link a pull request or branch to an issue to show that a fix is in progress

Sua resposta está incorreta

filter, sort, and search issues and pull requests that are relevant to the repository

close the issue and wait for other team members to alert you that they were working on it

send a message to the collaborators and ask them what issues they are working on

Explicação geral

You can link a pull request or branch to an issue to show that a fix is in progress and to automatically close the issue when the pull request or branch is merged. You can link an issue to a pull request manually or using a supported keyword in the pull request description. When you link a pull request to the issue the pull request addresses, collaborators can see that someone is working on the issue.

When you merge a linked pull request into the default branch of a repository, its linked issue is automatically closed.

********************  
**WRONG ANSWERS:**

- filtering issues and pull requests probably won't provide additional information if there are no additional detains in the issues that signify that somebody is working on it. Team members should link a PR or branch to the issue instead.
    
- sending an email isn't very collaborative and isn't even a GitHub feature. Team members should link a PR or branch to the issue instead.
    
- closing the issue would alert the users that created the issue and it might upset them since they might think the issue isn't important. Team members should link a PR or branch to the issue instead.

license

Sua seleção está correta

language

Explicação geral

GitHub topics all you to explore repositories in a particular subject area, find projects to contribute to, and discover new solutions to a specific problem.  Helpful topics to classify a repository include the repository's intended purpose, subject area, community, or language. Additionally, GitHub analyzes public repository content and generates suggested topics that repository admins can accept or reject. Private repository content is not analyzed and does not receive topic suggestions.

********************

**WRONG ANSWER:**

- GitHub topics don't typically include license information.  Most people place their license text in a file named `LICENSE.txt` (or `LICENSE.md` or `LICENSE.rst`) in the root of the repository

What is the primary purpose of a Version Control System (VCS)?

a system designed to execute source code developed by its users

a solution to automatically fix coding errors or issues within files from multiple developers

an app used by organizations to enforce code quality standards

Sua resposta está correta

a program or service used to track changes to a collection of files in a collaborative environment

Explicação geral

A Version Control System (VCS) is a tool that **helps manage changes to source code, documents, and other files in a collaborative environment**. It allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously by tracking changes made to the files over time. VCS provides features such as version history, branching, and merging, which help maintain a structured development process, reduce conflicts, and enable efficient collaboration. The main goal is to ensure that changes can be tracked, reverted if necessary, and integrated seamlessly into the project, promoting a systematic and organized approach to software development.

****************

**Wrong Answers:**

- VCS is not used to enforce code quality standards, as that is usually done using a different app or service
    
- VCS does not execute source code. It is designed to store different versions of the code or files
    
- VCS will not automatically fix coding errors or issues in files - it only stores the files

When working with GitHub repositories, what is the purpose of cloning a repository to your local machine?

cloning enables you to fetch only the latest changes and the main branch from GitHub.com, making it efficient for quick updates without downloading the entire repository.

Sua resposta está correta

cloning allows you to copy the entire repository from GitHub.com to your local machine or codespace

cloning is necessary only for creating backup copies of a repository and does not directly support collaborative development

cloning allows you to create a new, entirely separate repository for personal use, providing isolation from the original project.

Explicação geral

Cloning allows you to copy the entire repository from GitHub.com to your local machine or codespace, providing a full version history and enabling contributions to the project. This process facilitates collaboration by allowing contributors to work locally and make changes before pushing them to the remote repository.

********************

**WRONG ANSWERS:**

- Cloning is not meant to create entirely separate repositories. Instead, it is intended to replicate the existing project for collaborative development, ensuring contributors have a synchronized copy of the project.
    
- Cloning does not fetch only the latest changes but pulls down a full copy of all repository data. It provides a comprehensive snapshot of the project's current state, not just the latest updates.
    
- Cloning is not necessary only for creating backups. Its primary purpose is to support collaborative development by providing a local copy of the repository for contributors to work on and contribute changes.

What can be determined based on the following CODEOWNERS file?  

1. *.tf   @acme/infrastructure
2. /docs/ @dani

Sua resposta está correta

changes to files in the `docs` folder need to be reviewed by the GitHub user `dani` for a pull-request

review assignments are assigned by placing this CODEOWNERS file in the `owners` folder within the repository

changes to files with the `tf` extension need to be reviewed by the `infrastructure` user

the GitHub user `dani` has code ownership for all individual commits made in the `docs` folder

Explicação geral

Changes to files in the `docs` folder need to be reviewed by the user `dani`.  A CODEOWNERS file uses a pattern that follows most of the same rules used in [gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore#_pattern_format) files. The pattern is followed by one or more GitHub usernames or team names using the standard `@username` or `@org/team-name` format.

********************

**WRONG ANSWERS:**

- Teams can be specified as code owners. Teams should be identified in the format `@org/team-name.`  Changes to files with the `tf` extension need to be reviewed by the `infrastructure` **team** within the `acme` organization.
    
- To use a CODEOWNERS file, create a new file called `CODEOWNERS` in the `.github/`, `root`, or `docs/` directory of the repository, in the branch where you'd like to add the code owners. If the CODEOWNERS file exists in other directories it will be ignored.
    
- The CODEOWNERS file in a GitHub repository is used to specify individuals or teams responsible for code reviews in specific directories or for specific file types. It does not determine ownership of individual commits; rather, it influences the review process and notifies specified owners or teams when changes are made to the indicated files or directories.

As an open-source contributor on many projects, Kristina has trouble keeping up with notifications and mentions across projects. Today, she needs to review and take action on any comments where she was tagged or mentioned. How can Kristina quickly sort through notifications in GitHub so only comments where she was mentioned are shown?

Kristina doesn't need to do anything as her inbox will only show notifications for mentions, by default

Resposta correta

in her GitHub inbox, Kristina should filter messages using a filter query `reason:mention`

using her email client, Kristina can search for her username in unread messages

Sua resposta está incorreta

use a `Dependabot` custom filter to find specific alerts and notifications

Explicação geral

To use the notifications inbox on GitHub and GitHub Mobile, you must enable web and mobile notifications in your notification settings. To access your notifications inbox, in the upper-right corner of any page, click 🔔.

Your inbox shows all of the notifications that you haven't unsubscribed to or marked as **Done.** You can customize your inbox to best suit your workflow using filters, viewing all or just unread notifications, and grouping your notifications to get a quick overview.

By default, your inbox will show read and unread notifications. To see only unread notifications, click **Unread** or use the `is:unread` query.

********************  
**WRONG ANSWERS:**

- searching in her email client will result in all messages from GitHub and not necessarily only messages for `@mentions`. Also, using an external email client isn't a GitHub feature
    
- `Dependabot` will only show alerts for vulnerabilities, security alerts, and others. It is not designed to notify you about `@mentions`

Which GitHub Enterprise Cloud authentication options use a centralized identity provider (IdP) to control and secure access to organization resources?

Resposta correta

SAML single sign-on (SSO) and Enterprise Managed Users

Sua resposta está incorreta

GitHub does not currently support the use of centralized IdPs

GitHub personal accounts with 2FA

SAML single sign-on (SSO) excluding Enterprise Managed Users

Explicação geral

Both GitHub SAML SSO and Enterprise Managed Users can leverage an IdP for authentication.  If you configure SAML SSO, members of your organization will continue to sign into their personal accounts on GitHub.com. When a member accesses most resources within your organization, GitHub redirects the member to your IdP to authenticate. With Enterprise Managed Users, you manage the lifecycle and authentication of your users on GitHub.com from an external identity management system, or IdP.

********************

**WRONG ANSWERS:**

- If you configure additional SAML access restriction, each person you want to grant access to your enterprise must create and manage a personal account on GitHub.com. After you grant access to your enterprise, the member can access your enterprise's resources only after authenticating successfully for both the account on GitHub.com and for an account on your SAML identity provider (IdP).
    
- With authentication solely through GitHub.com, each person you want to grant access to your enterprise must create and manage a personal account on GitHub.com. After you grant access to your enterprise, the member can access your enterprise's resources after signing into the account on GitHub.com.  Personal accounts do not use a centralized IdP, even if configured with 2FA.
    
- GitHub tests and officially support the following IdPs: Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), Okta, OneLogin, PingOne, Shibboleth

Explicação geral

You can configure a GitHub Actions _workflow_ to be triggered when an _event_ occurs in your repository, such as a pull request being opened or an issue being created. Your workflow contains one or more _jobs_ which can run in sequential order or in parallel. Each job will run inside its own virtual machine _runner_, or inside a container, and has one or more _steps_ that either run a script that you define or run an _action_, which is a reusable extension that can simplify your workflow.

Sua resposta está correta

creating a private copy of a repository for personal use

Explicação geral

Forking on GitHub involves creating a personal copy of someone else's repository. This copy is independent and allows you to make changes without affecting the original repository. It's a common practice for contributing to open-source projects.

**WRONG ANSWERS:**

- Forking and branching are related concepts, but forking is specifically about creating an entire independent copy of a repository. Branching is done within a repository to work on different features or experiments.
    
- Forking is not about initiating a code review process. While forks can be used to propose changes through pull requests, the act of forking itself is about creating a personal copy for potential contributions.
    
- Forking involves creating a personal copy of a repository on GitHub, not cloning. Cloning is a different Git operation used to create a local copy of a repository.

Pergunta 41Correto

Why might a developer use a branch for development in Git or GitHub?

Sua resposta está correta

to isolate and work on a set of changes independently from the main project

to permanently separate code contributions made by different developers

to create a duplicate copy of the entire repository

to archive and store old versions of project files

Explicação geral

Developers use branches to create an isolated environment for specific tasks, such as developing new features or fixing bugs. By doing so, they can work independently without affecting the main codebase. This isolation allows for focused development, testing, and collaboration, and the changes can be later merged back into the main branch or another target branch.

********************

**WRONG ANSWERS:**

- creating a duplicate copy of the entire repository is unnecessary and not the primary purpose of using branches for development
    
- branches are not intended to separate code contributions permanently; they are temporary environments for isolated development tasks
    
- archiving old versions of project files is not the primary purpose of using branches; their main role is to facilitate concurrent and isolated development

Which is an alternative name for a version control system(VCS)?

Sua resposta está correta

source code management (SCM) system

revision control system (RCS)

code collaboration tool (CCT)

project lifecycle management (PLM) system

Explicação geral

Source Code Management (SCM) systems are a vital component of software development, utilized to control and manage changes to software during its lifecycle. These systems are also referred to as Version Control Systems (VCS), which are often used interchangeably. The official documentation for Git, one of the most popular VCS, can be located at git-scm.com. While Version Control is a crucial aspect of SCM, it is only one of the many practices involved in SCM. Hence, it is imperative to have a clear understanding of SCM systems to ensure efficient software development.

As a GitHub project manager, you are reaching the maximum limit of items in a project, and you need a way to manage the project's content so there are no interruptions. What GitHub feature can you archive items as they are closed as `completed` or `not planned`?

Sua resposta está correta

configure your project's built-in workflows to archive the desired items automatically

reopen the issues so the status is no longer `completed` or `not planned`

use filters to display only the items in the project view to stay below the maximum limit

change the milestone of the impacted issues or pull requests to a later date

Explicação geral

You can configure your project's built-in workflows to automatically archive items that match a filter. You can configure your project's built-in workflows to automatically archive items. Archiving items will help you stay below the limit of 1,200 items in each project. The auto-archive workflow supports a subset of filters. You can use the following filters when configuring your workflow.

********************  
**WRONG ANSWERS:**

- While filters would allow you to group items together, it wouldn't remove them from the project, resulting in you hitting the maximum number of items in the project
    
- changing the milestone wouldn't help here, as it wouldn't remove them from the project, resulting in you hitting the maximum number of items in the project
    
- reopening the issues wouldn't help because  it wouldn't remove them from the project, resulting in you hitting the maximum number of items in the project

GitHub offers several ways to customize a codespace. What can you customize? (select four)

Sua seleção está correta

change the display name of the codespace to help you differentiate multiple codespaces

change the operating system to either macOS or Windows to work on your preferred platform

Seleção correta

change the default region that your codespaces will be created to personalize where your data is held

select what Azure account the codespaces should be launched in to ensure the security of your application

Sua seleção está correta

select the machine type running your namespace so you have the appropriate resources

Seleção correta

change the shell in a codespace to keep the setup that you're used to

Explicação geral

You can change the codespace display name to one of your choice through GitHub.com or the GitHub CLI.

When you're working in a codespace, you can open a new terminal window with a shell of your choice, change your default shell for new terminal windows, or install a new shell. You can also use dotfiles to configure your shell.

Codespaces that use the default dev container image come with the `bash`, `zsh`, and `fish` shells installed. If you open a new codespace in the VS Code web client, or connect to a codespace over SSH, the terminal opens with a `bash` session running by default. In the VS Code desktop application, the default shell depends on your local settings and operating system.

By default the machine type with the lowest valid resources is used when you create a codespace. You can choose an alternative machine type either when you create a codespace or at any time after you've created a codespace.

You can manually select the region that your codespaces will be created in, allowing you to meet stringent security and compliance requirements. By default, your region is set automatically, based on your location.

********************  
**WRONG ANSWERS:**

- codespaces do not support Windows or macOS operating systems. They only support Linux
    
- you can't select the Azure account you want the codespace to run in. They will run in a GitHub-owned account but they can be [billed to your Azure account](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/connecting-an-azure-subscription)

What is the primary characteristic of open-source software?

Sua resposta está correta

free and accessible source code

developed by a single company

exclusive for commercial use

closed and proprietary code

Explicação geral

Open-source software is characterized by its **freely available source code** that can be viewed, modified, and redistributed by anyone. The openness of the source code allows collaboration and community-driven development.  
********************

**WRONG ANSWERS:**

- Open-source software is typically developed collaboratively by a community of contributors rather than being owned or controlled by a single company.
    
- Open-source software is the opposite of closed and proprietary software. Open-source code is open for inspection, modification, and distribution, while proprietary code is closed and not freely available.
    
- Open-source software can be used for both commercial and non-commercial purposes. It is not exclusive to any specific type of usage and encourages a wide range of applications and uses.

Thomas has created a new repository in the GitHub UI and needs to add a new file. What is the correct way to achieve this?

Use the `git push` command after adding the files to his local repository.

Create a new branch for each new file and manually add the files in the GitHub web interface.

Download the files to his local machine and copy them into the repository folder.

Sua resposta está correta

Click the "Add file" button on the repository's GitHub page to Create a New File or Upload an Existing file to the repository.

Explicação geral

You can upload and commit an existing file to a repository on GitHub or by using the command line. If the repository contains files for an **_existing_** project, you can create a new branch, upload the files, and submit a pull request.

**********

**WRONG ANSWERS:**

- Downloading and copying files manually into the repository folder differs from the recommended way to add files, especially for version-controlled projects.
    
- The `git push` command is used to push changes from a local repository to a remote repository. Still, it assumes that the files have already been added to the local repository using "git add."
    
- Creating a new branch and manually adding files in the GitHub web interface is not the standard method for adding files to a repository; it's more suitable for creating branches or making changes to existing files.

As a project manager overseeing a GitHub repository, you want to assess community engagement, track key metrics, and pull useful data. How might GitHub repository insights help you?

repository insights provides contributors email addresses for you to contact them directly

Sua resposta está correta

repository insights graph activity and contributor engagement of your project

repository insights allow you to track all open tasks and issues

repository insights highlight secret and code scanning alerts

Explicação geral

GitHub repository insights and the respective repository's graphs give you information on traffic, projects that depend on the repository, contributors and commits to the repository, and a repository's forks and network. You can use this data to get a better understanding of who's using your repository and why they're using it.

********************

**WRONG ANSWERS:**

- Secret and code scanning alerts pertains to security features rather than analytics and insights related to repository activity and engagement. Therefore these are managed and visible on the Security tab within GitHub.
    
- GitHub Repository does show contributor activity, but does not expose individual contributors' email addresses because of user privacy and security.
    
- GitHub Issues are used to track ideas, feedback, tasks, or bugs for work on GitHub.  While GitHub repository insights provide a summarized view of activity of issues (issues closed, issues opened, etc.) issue tracking is not part of GitHub insights, but rather can be found on the GitHub Issues tab.
