**An initiative definition** is a collection of policy definitions that are tailored towards achieving a singular overarching goal. Initiative definitions simplify managing and assigning policy definitions. They simplify by grouping a set of policies as one single item. For example, you could create an initiative titled **Enable Monitoring in Azure Security Center**, with a goal to monitor all the available security recommendations in your Azure Security Center.
