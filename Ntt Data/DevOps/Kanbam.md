**Kanban** is a method of working based on demand, not forecasting. It was created at Toyota in the 1950s as a necessary improvement plan in car production. 

It promotes team collaboration to optimise workflow, and allows the speed of teams to be measured.

Kanban's main features are: Reducing downtime, minimising waste in processes and visualisation of work in each state, especially in terms of progress.
