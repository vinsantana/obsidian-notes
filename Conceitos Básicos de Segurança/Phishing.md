1. A typical phishing attack consists of receiving **an e-mail claiming to be from some other company**.
2. There is a link to a **fake website**. The easiest way to identify it is noticing that the URL is not the right one, it uses different logos, or it is badly translated. 
3. In the URL you can see that website is not the real one. In addition, most of the commercial web **browser****s warn the user against possible attacks**.
